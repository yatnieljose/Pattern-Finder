# Pattern-Finder
SWENG 480/481 Team 22

The objective of this project is to design and construct an application that will assist software developers, of any level, in choosing the correct design pattern for problems they may have. Users will be able to enter a design problem (system task) and the application will give the user the design pattern that best suits their problemâ€™s needs. If the user has a general idea of the category that best suits them, they will be able to enter this into the application for more timely results. The application will also provide the two next-best design patterns that fit their design problem.
